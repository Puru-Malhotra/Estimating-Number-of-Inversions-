# Estimating-Number-of-Inversions-
Divide-and-Conquer--Sorting-and-Searching--and-Randomized-Algorithms by Stanford University on Coursera PA#2
This dataset file contains all of the 100,000 integers between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive) in some order, with no integer repeated.
Our task is to compute the number of inversions in the file given, where each line in the foile corresponds to an element in array(in given order).
We have implemented the fast divide-and-conquer algorithm which uses a merge sort approach to calculate the number of inversions required.
Complexity : O(nlogn)
